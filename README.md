# SnapSense.AI
Automatic image labeling software

ABOUT: We aim to create an image labeling model using computer vision to automatically label an image and all of the component/objects within the image with accurate and detailed descriptions.

CONCEPT: SnapSense AI will use a compartmentalized approach to labelling each section of an image. A reverse image search API will be used to identify objects and features in each section and a key word method will be used to identify a name and description for each feature.
